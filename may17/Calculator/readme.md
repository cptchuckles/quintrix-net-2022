## Calculator

Simple console application to do an arithmatic operation on two numbers.  Secret sauceage included.

It's nowhere near as abominable as my [JavaScript calculator](https://cptchuckles.github.io/calculator/) (please spare yourself the trauma, don't read the code)


# Installation
are you kidding me?

# Run
`dotnet run`
unless you are a VS pleb, then idk
