## Player model
This program implements a `IPlayerModel` interface, which accepts a Name and a `Regex`-approved Email Address.  It also affords the programmer the option to define custom task functions to be assigned to the `PlayerModel`'s `Task` delegate.

Users can interactively add players, display existing player information, and invoke player tasks.  Users are not able to define or assign custom tasks, because those must be created by the programmer.
